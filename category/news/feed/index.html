				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="">H<span class="comment-selection" data-editor-comment-id="815084b2-9220-435e-bbd2-bdb4d16a17dc">ackers a</span>ccess hidden information with some of the most complicated techniques available. But sometimes the most successful hacks are simple tricks hidden in plain sight, where you&#8217;d least expect them.</p>
<p class="">A widespread vulnerability, brought to <i>Mic</i>&#8216;s attention by New York-based developer Ben Halpern, allows hackers and online scammers to bait you with a link, then use it to hijack the browser tab you&#8217;re on to redirect you wherever they choose. You might not even notice.</p>
<p class=""><b>It&#8217;s called the <i>target=&#8221;_blank&#8221;</i> vulnerability.</b> Target Blank looks like a normal link you might see on Facebook. Click or tap the link, and a new tab opens that contains the site you were looking for — nothing unusual there.</p>
<p class="">The original tab — Facebook.com, for instance — is the one affected. The attackers can change it to whatever they want while you&#8217;re not paying attention, like a magician&#8217;s sleight-of-hand trick.</p>
<p class="">Don&#8217;t worry, the mobile apps you&#8217;re using are safe. It&#8217;s your browser that&#8217;s vulnerable. Many websites simply fail to defend themselves from it.</p>
<p class="">Twitter.com is affected (but just when you&#8217;re using <span class="comment-selection" data-editor-comment-id="b90de21f-a4dc-4460-b14b-243dc5db27f9">Safari)</span>. Facebook.com, too, regardless of the browser. And many more: Target Blank affects an untold number of sites across the internet that aren&#8217;t specifically watching for it, including this one — we&#8217;ve provided a demonstration later.</p>
<p class="">It&#8217;s also been around for a while. Halpern told <i>Mic</i> over the phone that Target Blank has been a widely known vulnerability for years in the development community, especially nefarious when used on social networks or online forums where malicious attackers can post whatever links they want. Few, however, thought that a giant like Facebook would be so susce<span class="comment-selection" data-editor-comment-id="aa8b6d81-08eb-4371-b1fa-cc16d0815d2d">ptible.</span></p>
<p class=""><b>Where the real danger lies:</b> Let&#8217;s say the hacker changed the original tab to a fake Facebook.com login page. Glance back at the original and you might think you&#8217;ve just been logged out, so you hastily type in your login info. Once the hacker has your Facebook password, they can access any other account where you&#8217;ve used the same password. (This is one of the most common ways of hacking someone).</p>
<p class="">But perhaps the most ominous aspect of Target Blank is that Facebook might not realize it&#8217;s being used to gain access to users&#8217; accounts. This isn&#8217;t an attack on Facebook&#8217;s servers — it&#8217;s all happening at the browser level.</p>

</figure>
<p class=""><b>Fixing the problem:</b> Halpern says it&#8217;s an easy exploit to stop, but it has to be done by the websites themselves.</p>
<p class="">For simpler sites, fixing it means adding the simple attribute <i>rel=&#8221;noopener&#8221;</i> to the code. Halpern suspects this is how Instagram patched up the vulnerability after he<span class="comment-selection" data-editor-comment-id="09374823-09c7-41c8-b89e-b80b21a08dc7"> </span><span class="comment-selection" data-editor-comment-id="09374823-09c7-41c8-b89e-b80b21a08dc7">blogged about it</span> last week. But in more complicated posting mechanisms like Facebook&#8217;s, which is more than a decade into its development, it can be a daunting project.</p>
<p class="">A Facebook representative told <i>Mic</i>, &#8220;We&#8217;re already in touch with the browsers to help them get this fixed. In the meantime, we have the ability to block a URL or domain if we detect abuse.&#8221;</p>
<p class="">&#8220;The basic prevention tactic is pretty damn basic if you&#8217;ve thought about it from the start of development,&#8221; Halpern told <i>Mic</i>. &#8220;But it hasn&#8217;t been treated as a true exploit, because it&#8217;s behavior you could easily prevent against. It&#8217;s technically known, but in developer circles, it&#8217;s very underestimated.&#8221; (We also reached out to Twitter for comment and will update this post if we hear back.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Until today, Kickass Torrents (KAT) was one of the most visited websites on the internet and brought in tens of millions of dollars a year in advertising.</p>
<p>Now, the website is no more.</p>
<p>It has disappeared from the internet and its 30-year-old alleged founder and operator, Ukranian Artem Vaulin, has been arrested and is facing extradition to the United States.</p>
<p>The domain names KAT used — and there are several — are in the process of being seized by the US Government.</p>
<p>It was the result of years of investigation by Jared Der-Yeghiayan, a special agent with the US Department of Homeland Security.</p>
<p>While he is not exactly a household name, he is the same investigator who brought down Ross Ulbricht, the person behind the infamous online drug marketplace, Silk Road.</p>
<p>The investigation was done both online and in meat space (the real world), and was a mixture of old-school police work and top-of-the-line digital forensics.</p>
<p>Mr Der-Yeghiayan laid out his evidence in the criminal complaint, filed to the US District Court of Illinois.</p>
<p>Here is how he tied Artem Vaulin to KAT:</p>
<h2>Follow the (advertising) money</h2>
<p>KAT sold adverts around its pirated content, and it is estimated the revenue brought in around $17 million a year.</p>
<p>It was that need to make money that opened KAT up for infiltration.</p>
<p>In late 2015, an undercover agent — known as UC-1 — who worked for the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) emailed KAT to enquire about advertising on the site.</p>
<p>The undercover agent said the advert was for a US study program and they were after an ad run of five days.</p>
<p>KAT said it would cost $300 a day to run the advert, with a total cost of $1,500.</p>
<p>Nearly a month after the initial enquiry, a KAT representative provided the agent with banking information to transfer the money for the advertising deal.</p>
<p>The bank account was in Latvia, in the name of &#8220;GA Star Trading&#8221;.</p>
<p>A few months later, the IRS transferred the money and the ad went live.</p>
<p>The IRS tried to organise a few more ad campaigns, and was given bank accounts in Estonia, as well as a Russian payment system, but the Latvian account had already given the US Government a way in.</p>
<p>With that information, agents requested the account holder information under the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT).</p>
<p>It is a set of agreements between countries to share and swap information with the aim of enforcing various laws.</p>
<p>The agents discovered the account had received 28,411,357 euros in deposits from August 2015 and March 2016.</p>
<h2>Watch those server logs</h2>
<p>Following the money revealed the scale of the operation, but Mr Der-Yeghiayan needed more.</p>
<p>He had been keeping an eye on KAT for years and at some point managed to identify two IP addresses of servers in Chicago.</p>
<p>The Chicago hosting company provided evidence that the servers had previously been tied to a known KAT domain name (kat.ph), and the IP addresses had been held by the person owning the servers for years.</p>
<p>In January 2016, investigators went in and took a forensic copy of the server for analysis, which revealed domain names again pointing to known KAT addresses.</p>
<p>The servers also contained files and access logs, and had user accounts called &#8220;Nike&#8221; — a username that Mr Vaulin had previously been known to use when instant messaging.</p>
<h2>The US Feds connect the dots</h2>
<p>With records from some of the world&#8217;s largest tech firms like Apple, Facebook and Google, it does not appear to have been particularly difficult to connect the dots.</p>
<p>At a point in the investigation, Mr Der-Yeghiayan worked out the Apple-run email address tirm@me.com belonged to Artem Vaulin.</p>
<p>That email address was the linchpin in the case:</p>
<ul>
<li>The username &#8220;tirm&#8221; was known as the administrator of KAT</li>
<li>Investigators discovered the email had made a purchase on iTunes using the IP address 109.86.226.203</li>
<li>They cross referenced the IP address with the social media site Facebook and found that someone had logged into KAT&#8217;s account with the same IP address that day</li>
<li>They found emails from known KAT domains in the email inbox</li>
<li>They found bug reports referencing the KAT website and feature requests, which were tasked to &#8220;Artem Vaulin&#8221;</li>
<li>The investigators found emails from KAT employees asking what to do about a copyright takedown request, with the subject line being: Ignore? The reply from Mr Vaulin was &#8220;of course&#8221;</li>
<li>They also found a series of test emails from admin@kat.ph and admin@kickasstorrents.com to the tirm@me.com account</li>
</ul>
<h2>Financially linking Vaulin to Kickass Torrents</h2>
<p>The first clue was via an email in 2010, which predated the 2012 switch to using an internal KAT email system.</p>
<p>A second clue came via KAT&#8217;s donation system, which allowed users to donate Bitcoin to an address maintained by a company called Coinbase.</p>
<p>And who did that Coinbase account belong to? An &#8220;Artem Vaulin&#8221; of Ukraine. The backup email was tirm@me.com.</p>
<p>Finally, there was the job of linking the GA Star Trading account — which had received more than 28 million euros in seven months — to Mr Vaulin&#8217;s Apple account.</p>
<p>Mr Der-Yeghiayan found connections to the Latvian GA Star Trading account in Mr Vaulin&#8217;s email account.</p>
<p>GA Star Trading&#8217;s bank account had received deposits in the hundreds of thousands of euros from a company called Castleton Trading, which was a shell company holding a 1/4 share in another company called Bitcoin Innovations Ltd.</p>
<p>The criminal complaint alleges that Mr Vaulin himself has the controlling interest in Bitcoin Innovations Ltd.</p>

<p>Marissa Mayer made Yahoo&#8217;s VPN famous by using it to check on the work habits of her employees. Lost amid today&#8217;s VPN conversation, however, is the fact that virtual private networks are much more than just pipelines for connecting remote employees to central work servers.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s a damn shame, because VPNs can be helpful tools for protecting online privacy, and you need not be an office drone to enjoy their benefits.</p>
<p>A VPN, as its name suggests, is just a virtual version of a secure, physical network—a web of computers linked together to share files and other resources. But VPNs connect to the outside world over the Internet, and they can serve to secure general Internet traffic in addition to corporate assets. In fact, the lion&#8217;s share of modern VPNs are encrypted, so computers, devices, and other networks that connect to them do so via encrypted tunnels.</p>
<h2>Why you want a VPN</h2>
<p>You have at least four great reasons to start using a VPN. First, you can use it to connect securely to a remote network via the Internet. Most companies maintain VPNs so that employees can access files, applications, printers, and other resources on the office network without compromising security, but you can also set up your own VPN to safely access your secure home network while you&#8217;re on the road.</p>
<p>Second, VPNs are particularly useful for connecting multiple networks together securely. For this reason, most businesses big and small rely on a VPN to share servers and other networked resources among multiple offices or stores across the globe. Even if you don&#8217;t have a chain of offices to worry about, you can use the same trick to connect multiple home networks or other networks for personal use.</p>
<figure class=" large"><a class="zoom article-gallery cboxElement" title="This diagram illustrates the difference between using an unencrypted connection and using a VPN-secured Internet connection at your average coffee shop." href="http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/01/vpn-graphic-100022486-orig.png"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/01/vpn-graphic-100022486-large.png" alt="" width="580" height="255" border="0" /></a></p>
<div class="zoom-icon"></div>
<figcaption>This diagram illustrates the difference between using an unencrypted connection and using a VPN-secured Internet connection at your average coffee shop.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Third, if you&#8217;re concerned about your online privacy, connecting to an encrypted VPN while you&#8217;re on a public or untrusted network—such as a Wi-Fi hotspot in a hotel or coffee shop—is a smart, simple security practice. Because the VPN encrypts your Internet traffic, it helps to stymie other people who may be trying to snoop on your browsing via Wi-Fi to capture your passwords.</p>
<p>Fourth and finally, one of the best reasons to use a VPN is to circumvent regional restrictions—known as geoblocking—on certain websites. Journalists and political dissidents use VPNs to get around state-sponsored censorship all the time, but you can also use a VPN for recreational purposes, such as connecting to a British VPN to watch the BBC iPlayer outside the UK. Because your Internet traffic routes through the VPN, it looks as if you&#8217;re just another British visitor.</p>
<h2>Pick your protocol</h2>
<p>When choosing a networking protocol for your VPN, you need worry only about the four most popular ones. Here&#8217;s a quick rundown, including the strengths and weaknesses of each.</p>
<aside id="" class="nativo-promo smartphone tablet desktop"></aside>
<p><strong>Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)</strong> is the least secure VPN method, but it’s a great starting point for your first VPN because almost every operating system supports it, including Windows, Mac OS, and even mobile OSs.</p>
<p><strong>Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)</strong> and <strong>Internet Protocol Security (IPsec)</strong> are more secure than PPTP and are almost as widely supported, but they are also more complicated to set up and are susceptible to the same connection issues as PPTP is.</p>
<p><strong>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)</strong> VPN systems provide the same level of security that you trust when you log on to banking sites and other sensitive domains. Most SSL VPNs are referred to as &#8220;clientless,&#8221; since you don&#8217;t need to be running a dedicated VPN client to connect to one of them. They&#8217;re my favorite kind of VPN because the connection happens via a Web browser and thus is easier and more reliable to use than PPTP, L2TP, or IPsec.</p>
<figure class=" large"><a class="zoom article-gallery cboxElement" title="An SSL VPN server is designed to be accessed via Web browser and creates encrypted channels so that you can safely access the server from anywhere." href="http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/03/ssl-vpn-100029646-orig.png"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/03/ssl-vpn-100029646-large.png" alt="" width="580" height="387" border="0" /></a></p>
<div class="zoom-icon"></div>
<figcaption>An SSL VPN server is designed to be accessed via Web browser and creates encrypted channels so that you can safely access the server from anywhere.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>OpenVPN</strong> is exactly what it sounds like: an open-source VPN system that&#8217;s based on SSL code. It&#8217;s free and secure, and it doesn&#8217;t suffer from connection issues, but using OpenVPN does require you to install a client since Windows, Mac OS X, and mobile devices don&#8217;t natively support it.</p>
<p>In short: When in doubt, try to use SSL or OpenVPN. Keep in mind that some of the services highlighted in the next section don’t use these protocols. Instead, they use their own proprietary VPN technology.</p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s talk about how to create and connect to your own VPN. If you want simple remote access to a single computer, consider using the VPN software built into Windows. If you’d like to network multiple computers together quickly through a VPN, consider installing stand-alone VPN server software.</p>
<p>If you need a more reliable and robust arrangement (one that also supports site-to-site connections), consider using a dedicated VPN router. And if you just want to use a VPN to secure your Internet traffic while you&#8217;re on public Wi-Fi hotspots and other untrusted networks—or to access regionally restricted sites—consider subscribing to a third-party hosted VPN provider.</p>
<h2>Set up a simple VPN with Windows</h2>
<p>Windows comes loaded with a VPN client that supports the PPTP and L2TP/IPsec protocols. The setup process is simple: If you&#8217;re using Windows 8, just bring up the Search charm, type <code>VPN</code>, and then launch the VPN wizard by clicking <em>Set up a virtual private network (VPN) connection.</em></p>
<p>You can use this client to connect securely to other Windows computers or to other VPN servers that support the PPTP and L2TP/IPsec protocols—you just need to provide the IP address or domain name of the VPN server to which you want to connect. If you&#8217;re connecting to a corporate or commercial VPN, you can contact the administrator to learn the proper IP address. If you&#8217;re running your own VPN server via Windows, you can figure out the server&#8217;s IP address by typing <code>CMD</code> in the Search charm, launching the Command Prompt, and typing <code>ipconfig</code>. This simple trick comes in handy when you&#8217;re setting up your Windows PC as a VPN server, and then connecting to it so that you can securely, remotely access your files from anywhere.</p>
<figure class=" large"><a class="zoom article-gallery cboxElement" title="Windows has a built-in VPN client, but you'll need to provide the connection information (namely, the IP address) for the VPN server you want to use." href="http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/03/windowsvpnconnect-100029258-orig.png"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/03/windowsvpnconnect-100029258-large.png" alt="" width="580" height="423" border="0" /></a></p>
<div class="zoom-icon"></div>
<figcaption>Windows has a built-in VPN client, but you&#8217;ll need to provide the connection information (namely, the IP address) for the VPN server you want to use.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Quick note: When setting up incoming PPTP VPN connections in Windows, you<em>must</em> configure your network router to forward VPN traffic to the Windows computer you want to access remotely. You can do this by logging in to the router’s control panel—consult the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions on how to do this—and configuring the port-forwarding or virtual-server settings to forward port 1723 to the IP address of the computer you wish to access. In addition, PPTP or VPN pass-through options need to be enabled in the firewall settings, but usually they&#8217;re switched on by default.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re using Windows 7 and you need to connect to a VPN or to accept incoming VPN connections in that OS.</p>
<h2>Use third-party software to create a VPN server</h2>
<p>If you’d like to create a VPN between multiple computers to share files and network resources without having to configure your router or to dedicate a PC to act as the VPN server, consider using third-party VPN software. Comodo Unite, Gbridge, and TeamViewer are all decent, reliable, and (most important) free.</p>
<figure class=" large"><a class="zoom article-gallery cboxElement" title="LogMeIn Hamachi is a simple, elegant, and secure VPN client that's free for up to five users. " href="http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/03/logmeinhamachi1-100029483-orig.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/03/logmeinhamachi1-100029483-large.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="378" border="0" /></a></p>
<div class="zoom-icon"></div>
<figcaption>LogMeIn Hamachi is a simple, elegant, and secure VPN client that&#8217;s free for up to five users.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You can also use <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/258926/logmein_hamachi_gives_small_businesses_most_of_the_vpn_they_need_for_free.html">LogMeIn Hamachi</a> for free with five or fewer users, but it&#8217;s good enough that if you have more than five PCs you want to link up securely—say, as part of your small-but-growing business—you should consider paying for the full service.</p>
<h2>Go whole hog with your own VPN router</h2>
<p>If you want to get your hands dirty while providing robust remote access to an entire network, or if you wish to create site-to-site connections, try setting up a router on your network with a VPN server and client. If you’re working on a budget, the cheapest way to set up your own dedicated VPN router is to upload <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/260281/how_to_enhance_your_router_with_open_source_firmware.html">aftermarket firmware</a> that enables VPN functionality, such as <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/">DD-WRT</a> or <a href="http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato">Tomato</a>, to an inexpensive consumer-level router.</p>

</figure>
<p>You can also purchase a specially designed router (commonly called a VPN router) with a VPN server built in, such as <a href="http://www.zyxel.com/us/en/products_services/zywall_usg_200_100_plus_100_50_20w_20.shtml?t=p">the ZyXel ZyWall 802.11n Wireless Internet Security Gigabit Firewall (USG20W)</a>, <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps11025/index.html">Cisco Wireless Network Security Firewall Router (RV220W)</a>, or <a href="http://www.netgear.com/business/products/security/UTM-series/UTM9S.aspx">Netgear ProSecure UTM Firewall with Wireless N (UTM9S)</a>.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re choosing a VPN router and third-party router firmware, make sure they support the VPN networking protocol you need for your devices. In addition, check the VPN router to verify how many simultaneous VPN users it supports.</p>
<h2>Let a third-party VPN provider worry about it</h2>
<p>If you merely want VPN access to cloak your Internet traffic while you&#8217;re using public Wi-Fi or another untrusted network, or to access regionally restricted sites, the simplest solution is to use a hosted VPN provider. <a href="http://www.anchorfree.com/hotspot-shield/">Hotspot Shield </a>is my favorite, as it offers both free and paid VPN services for Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android. <a href="http://www.hotspotvpn.com/">HotSpotVPN</a>,<a href="http://www.strongvpn.com/">StrongVPN</a>, and <a href="http://www.witopia.net/">WiTopia</a> are other paid services <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/217185/three_personal_vpns_offer_safer_wifi.html">we’ve reviewed</a> in the past.</p>
<figure class=" large"><a class="zoom article-gallery cboxElement" title="The Onion Router is an excellent, free utility that anonymizes your Internet activity through a series of servers scattered around the world." href="http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/03/torguide1-100029488-orig.png"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/03/torguide1-100029488-large.png" alt="" width="580" height="810" border="0" /></a></p>

<div class="zoom-icon">The Onion Router is an excellent, free utility that anonymizes your Internet activity through a series of servers scattered around the world.</div>
</figure>
<p>If you want to keep your browsing activity anonymous but can&#8217;t spare the cash for a paid VPN, check out the <a href="http://www.techhive.com/article/235174/tor_network_1.html">Onion Router</a>, a network of servers that can anonymize your Internet traffic for free. Visit the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en">TOR website</a> and download the latest browser bundle, and then start browsing with the TOR extensions enabled. The software will encrypt your connection to the TOR server before routing your Internet traffic through a randomized series of servers across the globe, slowing your browsing speed but cloaking your online activity from prying eyes.</p>
<p>No matter how you choose to go about it, start using a VPN today. It takes a bit of work up front, but spending the time to get on a VPN is one of the smartest, simplest steps you can take toward making your online activities more secure.</p>

<p>India has always been a free haven for accessing torrent websites, but it would now appear that even accessing these comes with a warning: three year jail, and a possible fine of Rs 3 lakh. In the past, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has issued orders for blocking of websites, over illegal and pirated content, but new ones keep popping up. Even so, accessing a torrents website was not a problem for most Indian users, and none of the blocked URLs ever flashed a warning sign with the possible consequences. That is until now.</p>
<p>In a story first reported by <em>India Today</em>, some torrents websites, which are blocked, flash a warning note telling users that logging on to such websites is a criminal offence and carries punishment.</p>
<p>The warning reads, “If you visit any such blocked website, the exact warning will read as follows:<br />
<strong><em>This URL has been blocked under the instructions of the Competent Government Authority or in compliance with the orders of a Court of competent jurisdiction. Viewing, downloading, exhibiting or duplicating an illicit copy of the contents under this URL is punishable as an offence under the laws of India, including but not limited to under Sections 63, 63-A, 65 and 65-A of the Copyright Act, 1957 which prescribe imprisonment for 3 years and also fine of upto Rs. 3,00,000/-. Any person aggrieved by any such blocking of this URL may contact at urlblock@tatacommunications.com who will, within 48 hours, provide you the details of relevant proceedings under which you can approach the relevant High Court or Authority for redressal of your grievance.” </em></strong></p>
<p>There are many ways to access illegal websites through DNS servers and IP address masking via VPN, and there’s a good chance many might just prefer to use those in order to access these websites.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="entry-content">
<figure class="featured-thumbnail full-width"><img src="https://d3kyzjuggeq6tf.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/pokemon-go-636x179.jpg" alt="Pokemon Go, Everything You Need To Know" /></figure>
<p><em>Pokemon Go is sweeping the globe, if you haven’t heard of it you aren’t paying attention. It’s fun for sure but also poses a risk for users many are not aware of. </em><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Tips And Tricks For Pokemon Go</strong></h3>
<p>I’m sure by now you’ve seen them walking around. People with their eyes glued to their phone, walking randomly around town not paying attention to what they are doing. And no, I don’t mean the average person whose life is driven by modern technology, I’m talking about players of Pokemon Go and if you haven’t heard of it yet you just haven’t been paying attention. It was released in early July, 2016 and became one of the most downloaded games ever, with more users than established websites like Snap Chat, Tinder and even Twitter. The game is fun, it gets people out and about and has captured a vast following. The down side is that along with a fun, Pokemon Go has brought risk to its players.</p>
<h3><strong>What Is Pokemon Go?</strong></h3>
<p>What exactly is Pokemon Go? It is the first augmented reality game for mobile devices. Augmented reality is a blend of virtual and real time, the game is projected onto the real world through your phone using the video camera and GPS system. Pokemon are cartoon creatures with magic powers, wild Pokemon can be caught and used for battle. Players seek and find Pokemon, train and upgrade them and then use them to fight each other in order to gain prestige and higher levels of power.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10150" src="https://d3kyzjuggeq6tf.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_8594-250x445.png" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" srcset="https://d3kyzjuggeq6tf.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_8594-250x445.png 250w, //www.le-vpn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_8594-700x1245.png 700w, //www.le-vpn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_8594-120x213.png 120w, //www.le-vpn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_8594.png 750w" alt="VPN to download Pokemon GO | Le VPN" />The name itself is a contraction of the words pocket and monster. The original game was made for the Nintendo Gameboy and was a wild success. Since the original release the franchise has expanded to become the number 2 ranked video game franchise after Nintendo’s Mario. The premise of the game is simple, Pokemon are fictional characters with super powers that can be collected like butterflies and insects with two goals in mind. The first is to collect all available Pokemon, completing the Pokedex, there are over 700 different ones so completing the Pokedex is quite challenging. The second is to use a team of Pokemon to fight with other Trainers, working your way up the chain until becoming champion.</p>
<p>To play users first download the game and create an avatar. The avatar is shown with a map of the players surroundings that uses your devices GPS and GoogleMaps data to show where available Pokemon, Pokestops and Gyms are located. Pokestops are where trainers can acquire tools and supplies for capturing and training the Pokemon like PokeBalls. PokeBalls are the tools with which a trainer catches wild Pokemon and are important to advancing in experience. Gyms are places where trainers can battle their Pokemon against other trainers teams to gain points and level up. Pokestops and Gyms are usually located near popular areas, the Pokemon themselves are typically found near areas similar to their type such as water, fire or earth. Players travel through the real world, often going for 5 or 10 kilometers in order to hit milestones within the game, and interact with the Pokestops and Gyms or capture Pokemon as they encounter them along the way.</p>
<p>People who collect and train Pokemon are called Trainers. Pokemon are caught using a Pokeball and fall under the influence of the trainer, they will do whatever the trainer asks them to, so long as they respect the trainer. The Pokemon can be trained to fight, do battle and level up at a place called a Gym. Battles with other Pokemon, teams and Gyms are non-lethal. A defeated Pokemon will “faint” and become unusable for a time, a successful Pokemon will gain experience points that lead to leveling up and increased powers. Some forms of Pokemon can also “evolve” into higher level creatures with enhanced powers.</p>
<h3><strong>Download Pokemon Go With A VPN</strong></h3>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-10149 alignright" src="https://d3kyzjuggeq6tf.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_8591-250x445.png" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" srcset="https://d3kyzjuggeq6tf.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_8591-250x445.png 250w, //www.le-vpn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_8591-700x1245.png 700w, //www.le-vpn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_8591-120x213.png 120w, //www.le-vpn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_8591.png 750w" alt="Download Pokemon Go With A VPN | Le VPN" />Downloading the game is easy, iOS users can get the game from the AppStore. Android users can get theirs from the Google Play store. Those without access to the store version can download through third party websites but there are risks regardless of how you do it. The first and foremost is that the game has led to a host of Pokemon Go hacking risks and those who chose to download from third party websites are at the most vulnerable. The first malware to be reported was targeted at Android users. Called DroidJack, it opens a back door to players’ devices granting hackers full access to information and accounts on the phone, and more are expected to follow.</p>
<p>Another major risk that arose right from the start is the iOS/Google issue where the game had full access to players’ devices. Two fixes emerged but neither was good for players of phone security. The first was to go into the Google account permissions page and remove Pokemon Go from access, a move that may cause the loss of a player’s game data. The second was to use a burner account, a major hassle just to play a game and no guarantee other forms of dangerous malware would be avoided. Google at least is working on their end of the issue but who’s to say other breaches of privacy aren’t present with this or another mobile app?</p>
<p>An even more pressing problem for Pokemon Go players around the world is the widespread use of mirror-games. Since Pokemon Go is not available in every country at the same time, and some countries are likely to never get it, many games have emerged which mimic the play. These mirror-games may host malware and are a high risk target for black hats with malware looking for a way into your account.</p>
<p>Loss of data is only one concern, security is another. A much bigger problem exists if hackers gain access to bank accounts or credit cards, an even bigger if they use your phone to geo-locate you. Muggers in O’Fallon, MI have already used a beacon within the game to lure in victims in order to break into cars and other mayhem. More advanced criminals could do much worse.</p>
<p>Experts agree, mobile apps are high risk targets for hackers and Pokemon Go is high on the list of apps targeted by top hackers. VPNs, virtual private networks, can solve many of the problems presented by hacking, malware and other potential hazards. Providers like <a href="http://vpnranked.com/nord">NordVPN</a> offer point-to-point solutions for Android and iOS mobile devices that will create a highly encrypted data tunnel originating at your device and secure all the way to its destination. This ensures that no outside influences can send malware or extract information from your device and covers all activity from your device, not just playing Pokemon Go. Risk of geo-targeting is also reduced, <a href="http://vpnranked.com/nord">NordVPN</a> can route your data through any of over 114 countries masking your true location.</p>
<h3><strong>Play Pokemon Go in Any Country with a VPN</strong></h3>
<p>Residents of countries without a Pokemon Go release, or where the Internet is censored will find using a VPN to download Pokemon GO especially useful. Not only will it allow them to bypass censors or geo-restrictions and access the Internet through their phone, it will provide a safe and secure connection which will ensure privacy and security. Using a VPN to unblock Pokemon Go in the countries where it hasn’t launched yet is another great tip, and <a href="http://vpnranked.com/nord">NordVPN</a> service with access points in over 100 countries is a great tool for that. Regardless the motive, there are clear reasons why using a VPN is the best way to download Pokemon Go, so why wait?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="entry-header">There has been a lot of hullabaloo over the last couple of months surrounding Netflix caving in to licence holders of television shows and movies, by clamping down on geo-unblocking services like UnoTelly and UnBlock Me.</p>
<header class="entry-header"></header>
<div class="entry-content">
<p>UnoTelly on the other hand, vowed to live up to its service level agreement, and quickly announced soon afterwards that it will thwart any effort by Netflix. Except it hasn’t…</p>
<p>The service’s ability to keep viewers from seeing the dreaded “You appear to be using a proxy or VPN service” has been shoddy at best, and after numerous region changes and IP blocking, it seems to have fallen flat for most people.</p>
<p>Luckily another service has come to my rescue, and I can happily report that I’m blissfully watching all the Hulu I can consume and power-bingeing through reruns of Orange is the New Black. Yes, I can just watch the local version of Netflix, but who wants to do that?</p>
<p>The service in question? <a href="http://vpnranked.com/nord">NordVPN</a>. And when something has the letters ‘VPN’ in its name, you know it means business.</p>
<p>Unlike geo-unblocking services, a VPN fools the entire internet as to your location, not just the service that you are trying to access. As an example, when I did an internet speed test, the most trusted source in connectivity speeds told me I was in California – when my feet were firmly planted in Johannesburg.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why you would use a VPN; it provides excellent online privacy, and of course (as a bit of a by-product) serves as a great alternative to getting around those pesky region-locked pieces of content.</p>
<p>“NordVPN gives you a private and fast path through the public Internet. All your data is protected every step of the way using revolutionary 2048-bit SSL encryption even a supercomputer can’t crack,” NordVPN explains on its website.</p>
<p>The service can be used in two ways: a small desktop application, or straight through your VPN-enabled router.</p>
<h2>Desktop</h2>
<p>The desktop application is super easy to set up. All you have to do is download the 18MB app and enter your credentials. From there, you will be able to select a country you want to connect to, or a specific server. Hit ‘Connect’ and Bob’s your uncle.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.htxt.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Capture-9.jpg" alt="" width="358" height="32" /></p>
<p>It is really one of the simplest setups that I have ever used to watch Netflix and Hulu on a desktop, and the only thing that you need to make sure of when selecting a server (or a country) is that it caters for the service you want to access.</p>
<p>NordVPN works differently to other VPNs, in the sense that it has hundreds of servers scattered across the world. One US server might only give you access to Netflix, where another will also add Hulu. This is done to spread the load, to make sure that everything is also up-and-running. Each server’s load is also shown, so you can select one that is not too busy.</p>
<p>It should go without saying then, that it will give you access to all the location-locked content from a host of countries – like Zattoo and Zdf in Germany, Brazil MTV in Brazil, Plus7 in Australia and BBC and Sky in the UK (to name a few).</p>
<p>It also has a number of settings that you don’t really need to tinker with, but it does feature DNS Leak Protection (preventing DNS servers from sending unencrypted queries outside VPN tunnels), and Smart-Play, which is actually pretty cool.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.htxt.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Capture2-5.jpg" alt="" width="325" height="571" /></p>
<p>It re-routes your traffic through a country where the content you want to watch is available. As an example, if you have set your server as US but want to watch BBC in the UK, by default it won’t allow you. Flip Smart-Play on, and it will re-route our desktop traffic through the US to the UK.</p>
<p>For the most part, the desktop application works perfectly in accessing the content that others don’t want you to watch.</p>
<p>This setup enable users to watch through a desktop, but if you want to beam all the glorious content throughout your house over WiFi, it’s a bit trickier. Well, not really, but you might want to watch NordVPN’s video tutorials.</p>
<h2>Router</h2>
<p>In short, if you have a VPN-enabled router (one that allows for a VPN connection), all you have to do is go into your router’s admin page, find the VPN option, and add the details as per the detailed tutorial. The service is compatible with DD-WRT, Tomato, Synology, Asus WRT and Raspberry Pi routers.</p>
<p>Besides for the VPN setup, things can get tricky here, as you will need to have a look at the NordVPN server list (the same one that was accessed through the desktop app) and input the correct server number for the channels that you want to access.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.htxt.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Capture3-2.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="481" /></p>
<p>But once that is done, you are fully set up and ready to go. The issue here is that you will have to manually activate and deactivate servers as needed, as most routers can only connect through one server at a time.</p>
<p>As an example, you won’t be able to have a Netflix/Hulu server active in your router setup, as well as a dedicated server for peer2peer connections. (Yes, it has dedicated servers for those). It’s slightly a hassle, but if you only want to watch Netflix and Hulu, select a server that does both, and you wouldn’t need to change it at all.</p>
<p>And that is all you need to do. There is no updating of IP addresses when the router restarts, and there is no clunky app to navigate.</p>
<p>Just a quick note on the dedicated servers: NordVPN has servers for specific needs and boasts a number of Anti-DDOS, Ultra-Fast TV, Double VPN, Tor Over VPN and Dedicated IP servers in addition to standard VPN servers. The servers also support PPTP, L2TP, OpenVPN TCP, OpenVPN, UDP, Proxy, and/or Socks5 connections.</p>
<h2>Limitations and issues</h2>
<p>There are some limitations to a router setup though, and the biggest that I have seen so far is that only the US servers support Netflix. So if you want to watch season 2 of Better Call Saul on Netflix in the UK through your router’s connection, you are out of luck.</p>
<p>I have also noticed on a few occasions that Hulu will sporadically throw out a proxy warning while the VPN is active, which can cause a bit of panic in the house. Assuming that everything is set up correctly, a frantic dig through the router settings could ensue. But that shouldn’t be anything to worry about, as I have experienced that it usually corrects itself after a couple of minutes, or I just swap to a different server.</p>
<p>I have also discovered, going through the router setup, that mobile devices connected to the network would play Hulu or Netflix content, but gaming systems like PlayStation 3 and the Xbox One wouldn’t. That too, usually corrects itself after some tinkering.</p>
<p>Its not a big deal, but it can be somewhat frustrating if you are in the middle of a really riveting series. At least now I know how to fix it, and I understand that no system is fool-proof, so I just brush it off as par-for-the-course.</p>
<p>Another oddity that I have encountered, is that my home network gets pulled completely flat if I activate a peer-2-peer on my desktop without switching to a dedicated P2P connection. It is almost as if all available bandwidth is being pushed into that connection, killing every other connection – except my P2P shows a data download rate of about 5 kb/s.</p>
<p>It’s a product I’d quite gladly re-subscribe to once my month winds down. The setup time was literally a couple of minutes, and it provides access to the channels/shows that I want to watch. Yes, there are a number of technical issues, but from a South African stand point, we can’t be too picky when it comes to services that actually want to help us out.</p>
<p>I’m not a huge fan of having to swap servers when I want to change content, but I’m sure I will be able to live with it as Hulu and Netflix is predominantly what we use it for – and I suspect that is what most South African would also use.</p>
<p>With that said, I don’t think that I would ever go back to any other VPN service. Besides the minor issues mentioned above, I have been pretty content with my streaming connections so far. The big thing for me here is that I don’t need to update my IP address every 30 minutes, which was usually the case with UnoTelly. There is also something about NordVPN that just looks more professional than other operations.</p>
<p>There is one small caveat though, especially if you are coming from UnoTelly – it is double the price of a standard UnoTelly subscription ($4) that is needed for Hulu and Netflix, but it is the same price as UnoTelly’s VPN option at $8.</p>
