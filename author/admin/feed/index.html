<p><img class="alignleft" src="https://www.onlinesellersinsurance.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Online-Sellers-Insurance-Amazon-Australia-Amazon-Insurance-1.png" width="405" height="224" /></p>
<p>Orders received by Amazon&#8217;s American website will no longer be shipped to Australia. The same rule applies for Amazon&#8217;s other overseas websites.</p>
<p>However, there may be <strong>ways to circumvent the policy</strong> — if you&#8217;re prepared to invest some time and money.</p>
<p>While Amazon will not ship to Australian customers, <strong>US parcel shipping services will not be subject to any ban</strong>.</p>
<p>These forward-shipping services provide a US delivery address for retail purchases, allowing goods to be sent overseas without triggering any shipping restrictions.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s still the tricky question of <strong>how to access the Amazon US website</strong> in the first place.</p>
<p>You will have to use a <strong>virtual private network (VPN)</strong> to get around the Amazon geo-ban and access the US site.</p>
<p>VPN services connect you to a public network that can be based in another country, which makes your computer look like it is based in the country you choose.</p>
<p>There are <strong>no laws in Australia currently preventing people using a VPN</strong>.</p>
<p>But it is technically a violation of the terms of service of the provider, in this case Amazon, to which you agree when you sign up.</p>
<p>So they are within their rights to <strong>ban you from using the service if caught</strong>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Online retail giant Amazon will block Australian consumers from its global sites to counter new laws to force it to collect the good and services tax on transactions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>From July 1 when the new GST regulations begin, Australian consumers shopping on Amazon international sites will be redirected to the local Australian site.</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/9227860-3x2-700x467.jpg" width="364" height="252" /></p>
<p>Amazon said on Thursday it will force Australians to use its Australian website instead of its much larger US site to avoid a new sales tax, setting the stage for a showdown with rival eBay Inc in the No. 12 economy.</p>
<p>The retail giant said it would subject Australians to the process known as &#8220;geoblocking&#8221; from July 1, when a 10 percent Goods and Services Tax (GST) applies to imported online goods worth less than AUD1,000 (USD756).</p>
<p>&#8220;While we regret any inconvenience this may cause customers, we have had to assess the workability of the legislation as a global business with multiple international sites,&#8221; an Amazon spokesman said, adding that the firm was taking the measure to comply with the legislation and not to avoid paying tax.</p>
<p>The move will likely drive traffic to Amazon&#8217;s Australian website, testing the patience of shoppers who have complained about its thin product range &#8211; a tenth the range of its US site &#8211; and uncompetitive prices since it began taking orders in December.</p>
<p>It may also benefit Amazon&#8217;s main rivals, from California-headquartered online market eBay to smaller Australian merchants which had campaigned to have the GST apply to all goods shipped from overseas.</p>
<p>National Retail Association CEO Dominique Lamb said Amazon&#8217;s move was a surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have to wonder if they are trying to funnel more traffic to its Australian website,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>An eBay spokesman said the US company was working on a way to collect the Australian tax from sellers around the world without cutting access for Australians.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="entry-summary">
<p class="entry-lead">Village Roadshow and several major Hollywood studios have won a blocking injunction against a pirate IPTV service. HD Subs Plus delivers around 600 live premium channels plus hundreds of movies on demand, but the service will now be blocked by ISPs across Australia. More blocking requests were also filed today against torrent and streaming sites.</p>
</div>
<div class="entry-content">
<p><img class="alignright size-large" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/iptv.jpg" width="234" height="155" />After successful applying for ISP blocks against dozens of traditional torrent and streaming portals, Village Roadshow and a coalition of movie studios switched tack last year.</p>
<p>With the threat of pirate subscription IPTV services looming large, Roadshow, Disney, Universal, Warner Bros, Twentieth Century Fox, and Paramount <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/aussie-pirate-blocking-efforts-switch-to-premium-iptv-171106/">targeted</a> HDSubs+ (also known as PressPlayPlus), a fairly well-known service that provides hundreds of otherwise premium live channels, movies, and sports for a relatively small monthly fee.</p>
<p>The injunction, which was filed last October, targets Australia’s largest ISPs including Telstra, Optus, TPG, and Vocus, plus subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Unlike blocking injunctions targeting regular sites, the studios sought to have several elements of HD Subs+ infrastructure rendered inaccessible, so that its sales platform, EPG (electronic program guide), software (such as an Android and set-top box app), updates, and sundry other services would fail to operate in Australia.</p>
<p>After a six month wait, the Federal Court granted the application earlier today, compelling Australia’s ISPs to block “16 online locations” associated with the HD Subs+ service, rendering its TV services inaccessible Down Under.</p>
<p>“Each respondent must, within 15 business days of service of these orders, take reasonable steps to disable access to the target online locations,” said Justice Nicholas, as quoted by <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/roadshow-wins-smart-tv-piracy-website-blocks/">ZDNet</a>.</p>
<p><center><b>A small selection of channels in the HDSubs+ package</b><a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/hdsubs1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-146813" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/hdsubs1.png" alt="" width="755" height="735" /></a></center>The ISPs were given flexibility in how to implement the ban, with the Judge noting that DNS blocking, IP address blocking or rerouting, URL blocking, or “any alternative technical means for disabling access”, would be acceptable.</p>
<p>The rightsholders are required to pay a fee of AU$50 fee for each domain they want to block but Village Roadshow says it doesn’t mind doing so, since blocking is in “public interest”. Continuing a pattern established last year, none of the ISPs showed up to the judgment.</p>
<p>A similar IPTV blocking application was filed by Hong Kong-based broadcaster Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB) last year.</p>
<p>TVB wants ISPs including Telstra, Optus, Vocus, and TPG plus their subsidiaries to block access to seven Android-based services named as A1, BlueTV, EVPAD, FunTV, MoonBox, Unblock, and hTV5.</p>
<p>The application was previously heard alongside the HD Subs+ case but will now be handled separately following complications. In April it was <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/tv-broadcaster-wants-app-stores-blocked-to-prevent-piracy-180416/">revealed</a> that TVB not only wants to block Internet locations related to the technical operation of the service, but also hosting sites that fulfill a role similar to that of Google Play or Apple’s App Store.</p>
<p>TVB wants to have these app marketplaces blocked by Australian ISPs, which would not only render the illicit apps inaccessible to the public but all of the non-infringing ones too.</p>
<p>Justice Nicholas will now have to decide whether the “primary purpose” of these marketplaces is to infringe or facilitate the infringement of TVB’s copyrights. However, there is also a question of whether China-focused live programming has copyright status in Australia. An additional hearing is scheduled for May 2 for these matters to be addressed.</p>
<p>Also on Friday, Foxtel filed yet another blocking application targeting “15 online locations” involving 27 domain names connected to traditional BitTorrent and streaming services.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.computerworld.com.au/article/640567/foxtel-wants-make-it-cheaper-block-pirate-sites/">ComputerWorld</a> the injunction targets the same set of ISPs but this time around, Foxtel is trying to save on costs.</p>
<p>The company doesn’t want to have expert witnesses present in court, doesn’t want to stage live demos of websites, and would like to rely on videos and screenshots instead. Foxtel also says that if the ISPs agree, it won’t serve its evidence on them as it has done previously.</p>
<p>The company asked Justice Nicholas to deal with the injunction application “on paper” but he declined, setting a hearing for June 18 but accepting screenshots and videos as evidence.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Mysterium ICO Brings In Big Bucks For Decentralized VPN Services</h1>
<p>Mysterium Network developers are building a decentralized VPN and just received 14,000,000 Swiss francs from investors in exchange for MYST tokens to help make it happen.</p>

<p>On May 30, 2017, decentralized <abbr class="glossarizer_replaced" title="A method used to add security and privacy to private and public networks, like WiFi Hotspots and the Internet. VPNs are most often used by corporations to protect sensitive data.">VPN</abbr> platform Mysterium held an <abbr class="glossarizer_replaced" title="The public release of a new token or coin. ">initial coin offering</abbr> (<abbr class="glossarizer_replaced" title="The public release of a new token or coin. ">ICO</abbr>) for less than 45 minutes.

<p>Fortune favored the developers of Mysterium, whose token sale will help them reach core development, operational, marketing, sales, and legal compliance goals. When the soft cap of 6,000,000 CHF was achieved, Mysterium tweeted the following:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550">

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Less than 20 minutes after this tweet, the number had more than doubled to the hard cap of 14,000,000 CHF, signaling the end of the sale.</p>
<p>Mysterium is powered by partnerships with digital asset marketplace TokenMarket, crypto financial broker <abbr class="glossarizer_replaced" title="A type of cryptocurrency in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank.

">Bitcoin</abbr> Suisse AG, and open source framework Zeppelin. According to its website, Mysterium&#8217;s Network will act as a marketplace where providers can sell unused traffic, and customers can use the network to buy VPN services. The network relies on the existing architecture of VPN protocols and the Ethereum blockchain&#8217;s <abbr class="glossarizer_replaced" title="An executable distributed code contract (often referred to as a &quot;smart contract&quot;) is a computerized transaction protocol that executes the terms of a contract under designated conditions, also referred to as a smart contract.">executable distributed code contracts</abbr> (<abbr class="glossarizer_replaced" title="An executable distributed code contract (often referred to as a &quot;smart contract&quot;) is a computerized transaction protocol that executes the terms of a contract under designated conditions, also referred to as a smart contract.">EDCCs</abbr>).</p>

According to Mysterium&#8217;s <a href="https://mysterium.network/whitepaper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">white paper</a>, these will be denominated in MYST initially, but that’s subject to change in the future. The method of <abbr class="glossarizer_replaced" title="Mining is the process of repeatedly aggregating transactions, constructing a block and trying difference nonces until a nonce is found that satisfies the proof of work condition. If a miner gets lucky and produces a valid block, they are granted a certain number of coins as a reward as well as all of the transaction fees in the block, and all miners start trying to create a new block containing the hash of the newly generated block as their parent.">mining</abbr> is also a bit different. Rather than being rewarded in computing power (often referred to as <abbr class="glossarizer_replaced" title="Simplified: The proof of work (POW) system is a measure to deny attacks on the blockchain network. It requires work and more processing time from the requestor (computer). This protocol is in place to disallow spam on the blockchain network, deter other abuses such as double-spending, and confirm that a new block is found/formed. Bitcoin is just one example of a coin that utilizes the POW protocol. One important property of a block in Bitcoin, Ethereum and many other crypto-ledgers is that the hash of the block must be smaller than some target value. The reason this is necessary is that in a decentralized system anyone can produce blocks, so in order to prevent the network from being flooded with blocks, and to provide a way of measuring how much consensus there is behind a particular version of the blockchain, it must in some way be hard to produce a block. Because hashes are pseudorandom, finding a block whose hash is less than 0000000100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 takes an average of 4.3 billion attempts. In all such systems, the target value self-adjusts so that on average one node in the network finds a block every N minutes (eg. N = 10 for Bitcoin and 1 for Ethereum). ">Proof-of-Work</abbr>) or ownership in currency (called <abbr class="glossarizer_replaced" title="With the proof of stake (POS) system, it varies from the POW in that the computer asks users (those who already hold stake of a coin) to repeatedly run hashing algorithms to validate electronic transactions. This method requires less computing power and energy- (which is also a balance to the costly energy of pure POW systems).">Proof-of-Stake</abbr>), node operators are provided MYST tokens for sharing bandwidth. Mysterium may also integrate the award of commissions for transactions on the Mysterium Network in non-MYST currencies.</p>
<p>The white paper provides details as to how nodes interact with the Ethereum blockchain:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.ethnews.com/images/content/pic-05-30-2017.png" alt="" width="652" height="821" />The core components of the Mysterium Network integrate together to create a decentralized platform. Ethereum&#8217;s EDCCs allow for robust payment handling with decentralized code. An identity service and registry ensure client-to-service-provider security.

<p class="c-bw">In addition to the traditional payment methods, you can buy <a href="http://vpnranked.com/nord">NordVPN</a> with Bitcoin – a virtual payment option that does not require your real name, surname, address or credit card details.</p>
<p class="c-bw">Many Internet users have already acknowledged the potential risks of having their online activity exposed and passed to the third parties. So it is no surprise that the popularity of VPN services is steadily growing.</p>
<p class="c-bw"><strong>However, when choosing a VPN service, it is a must to look for providers that:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="space-xs-0"><strong>Rely on a strict no logs policy</strong> to be sure that none of your private data is logged, monitored or shared at any time;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="space-xs-0"><strong>Use shared IP addresses</strong>, as it makes almost impossible to identify a single user account if hundreds of people use the same IP address simultaneously;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="space-xs-0"><strong>Offer alternative payment options</strong>, having in mind that PayPal and credit card histories are stored for a very long time and shared with banks, tax authorities, third party payment processors, etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="c-bw">Therefore, customers who do not wish to tie their identities to payments for VPN can avoid that by using Bitcoin, the world’s most popular cryptocurrency. Paying with Bitcoins means that <a href="http://vpnranked.com/nord">NordVPN</a> does not have names and bank details to associate with the Bitcoin wallet accounts, so their purchases stay completely anonymous.</p>
<p class="c-bw">For this reason, in addition to the traditional payment methods like credit cards or PayPal, <a href="http://vpnranked.com/nord">NordVPN</a> accepts payments in <strong>Bitcoin</strong> – a virtual currency that has only the paid amount linked to the single user account. So if you are looking for secure and private online browsing experience, this private payment method is a good way to start.</p>
<h5 class="text-center space-xs-2 space-sm-2">Why Bitcoins?</h5>
<p class="c-bw">There are two sides to Bitcoin in regards to online privacy. The first is that Bitcoin wallets, which are identified by a Bitcoin address, can be created as desired and maintained without anything linked back to the individual user.</p>
<p class="c-bw">But at the same time Bitcoin transactions associated with a specific wallet can be easily tracked.</p>
<p class="c-bw"><strong>So if you want to preserve your private information when paying with Bitcoin, you should:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="space-xs-0">Use a Bitcoin wallet registered with a disposable and anonymous email address;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="space-xs-0">Use a different wallet for each online transaction to make sure that none of them can be traced back to you.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="c-bw">On the practical side, Bitcoin is cheaper to use than many other payment options as it is not linked to any country or subject to regulation, especially when it comes to making international transactions.</p>
<h5 class="text-center space-xs-2 space-sm-2">Buy <a href="http://vpnranked.com/nord">NordVPN</a> with Bitcoin in 3 simple steps</h5>
<div class="row no-padding">
<div class="col-xs-1 text-center">
<h5>1. <strong style="font-size: 16px;">Get a Bitcoin wallet.</strong><span style="font-size: 16px;"> We recommend the secure and open-source BitPay wallet, which is available on Google Play, iOS App Store, and Windows Store. It is an excellent option, as it dynamically calculates sufficient miner fees.</span></h5>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row no-padding">
<div class="col-xs-1 text-center">
<h5>2. <strong style="font-size: 16px;">Buy some Bitcoins.</strong><span style="font-size: 16px;"> The exchanges are accessible all around the world. Therefore, any currency can be converted into and out of Bitcoin.</span></h5>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row no-padding">
<div class="col-xs-1 text-center">
<h5>3. <strong style="font-size: 16px;">Make the payment.</strong><span style="font-size: 16px;"> If you choose to pay for our VPN service with Bitcoin, you will be automatically redirected to BitPay to complete your purchase. Then you can choose one of three simple payment options, such as scan the QR code, open in wallet or send the payment manually.</span></h5>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chinese authorities have issued a warning to five of the country&#8217;s well-known e-commerce platforms, over the sale of illegal virtual private networks (VPNs); that allows users to evade state censorship controls. Online retailers named in the notice include Alibaba, social shopping network Mogujie, and entertainment platforms Xiami and Peiyinxiu.</p>
<p><img class="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/neowin/news/images/uploaded/2015/01/chinese_flag_(beijing)_-_img_1104_story.jpg" width="428" height="285" /></p>
<p>This step is the latest in a chain of measures the Chinese authorities have taken in order to maintain more control over online content. A little over a month ago, China blocked VPN access for individuals, instructing companies to register with the government. Later on, complying with this mandate, Apple removed all major VPN apps from the Chinese App Store.</p>
<p>The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), the country&#8217;s top cyber regulator, has instructed the aforementioned websites to carry out immediate &#8220;self-examination and correction&#8221;, saying that:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The CAC has ordered these five sites to immediately carry out a comprehensive clean-up of harmful information, close corresponding illegal accounts, and submit a rectification report by a deadline.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The CAC put several social media platforms under investigation a few days ago for failing to adhere to cyber laws.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Russian President Vladimir Putin also signed a bill banning the use of proxies and virtual private networks mere weeks ago. Only a handful of countries have engaged in blocking VPNs until now, but it is unclear if more will follow suit.</p>
<p><a href="http://vpnranked.com/nord">NordVPN</a> is still able to bypass all Chinese blocks to date and is widely regarded as the worlds greatest and most secure VPN.</p>

<p>Among the many, many troubling stories in the news these days is the vote by Congress to lift regulations that require your internet service provider to get permission before selling your private data. This, along with a slew of malicious hacks reported over the past few years, has helped make the public aware of the critical importance of internet security.</p>
<p>Now many people are looking for ways to stay safe and anonymous. Here’s one obvious solution: Get a <a href="http://vpnranked.com">virtual private network</a>. Here are three reasons you should seek out a VPN solution today.</p>
<h3>A VPN can keep you safe</h3>
<p>For most people, it’s pretty much impossible to avoid using public Wi-Fi. Whether at an airport lounge, a coffee shop or the library, these hotspots are risky in terms of safety and privacy. Over public Wi-Fi connections, hackers can pretty easily snoop on your sensitive information.</p>
<p>However, with a VPN, all your web traffic gets transmitted through encrypted connections — even on open Wi-Fi networks — so all the hackers will get are reams of useless digital gibberish.</p>
<h3>Virtual private network: Privacy is right in the name</h3>
<p>Here’s a harsh truth: It’s not just your ISP that can sell your browsing data to hungry advertisers. Companies like Google and Facebook track your every move, maintaining long, detailed logs of your personal data that can be sold to basically any bidder.</p>
<p>One of the most effective and practical ways to browse with true anonymity is with a VPN. Just as VPNs can shield you from hackers, they will encrypt your traffic so interested parties won’t be able to see your location, the content you interact with or the websites you visit.</p>
<h3>VPNs unlock geo-restricted content</h3>
<p>When traveling to another country, one of the last things you want to see is that your streaming videos didn’t make the trip with you. Location restrictions on services like Netflix and Hulu can prove frustrating, but VPNs offer a fantastic way to sidestep them.</p>
<p>With a VPN, you can set your IP address to any location you choose among a network of VPN server nodes, convincing the geo-restricted site that you’re somewhere it’s willing to stream to. Take that, content blockers.</p>
<p>These days, VPNs are extremely affordable and easy to operate, thanks to a wave of new user-friendly providers like <a href="http://vpnranked.com/nord">NordVPN</a>. This easy-to-use but feature-rich VPN will protect you against hacking, snooping and geo-restrictions.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/88e05a5d8f20e133ab0f98c4a30b0d1e" /></p>
<p>AS OF Good Friday, Australian internet service providers (ISPs) and telecommunications companies are officially required to collect “metadata” about their customers’ communications. According to the legislation, this data includes:</p>
<p>• Name, address, date of birth, email addresses and other identifying information of the person that holds an account.</p>
<p>• Details of any communication, including:</p>
<p>— the mode of communication (voice, sms, email, chat, forum, social media)</p>
<p>— the location of the person at the start and end of the communication</p>
<p>— the address and details of the receiver of the communication</p>
<p>— the network used for the communication (ADSL, Wi-Fi, VoIP, cable, etc).</p>
<p>What it does not include is details of websites a person visits, and nor does it include information about what they did on those sites.</p>
<p>There is still confusion on this point amongst the public and media, and more generally about what the data retention law really means for Australians. There is still talk about the need to “hide online browsing” because of this legislation, when in fact ISPs are not required to save such information.</p>
<p>Even in the US where privacy rules have been overturned by the House of Representatives — theoretically allowing ISPs to sell or market customer’s browsing history — in practice, ISPs have a vested interest in maintaining customer privacy.</p>
<p>There is still a strong argument to be made regarding being concerned about the metadata being stored, and consequently about the steps Australians can make to protect their privacy.</p>
<p>The list of Australian government departments that theoretically can access metadata collected by the ISPs and telecommunications companies is extensive and wide ranging. This means that a larger part of Australians’ lives become accessible to these agencies, and the information collected could potentially be used against them.</p>
<p>The most effective way of protecting privacy of communications on the internet is to use a virtual private network (VPN), which will quite simply prevent all details of communications (and yes, also browsing history) from being visible to an ISP.</p>
<p><b>THE RISKS OF USING A VPN</b></p>
<p>Although the use of a VPN is a good idea for protecting privacy, there are still some risks involved in using this technology.</p>
<p>Firstly, VPN users have to trust that the company providing the services is actually doing what they claim and really protecting their customers. Recently, a large number of Android VPN apps have been shown to have significant privacy and security issues with them. Even with the better-known VPN providers, customers are required to simply trust that the VPN provider is doing what they claim and not keeping records or logs.</p>
<p>There are a set of well known and well regarded VPN providers that have “mostly” operated without controversy. VPN software has become extremely simple to operate on PCs and mobile devices. With growing numbers of customers, VPN providers have made an effort to scale servers and bandwidth to make the potential slowdowns from using a VPN less noticeable.</p>
<p>Theoretically, a VPN can be set up to operate continuously whenever there is a network connection. This would mean that any subsequent communications done over that network would be entirely private.</p>
<p>Using a mobile VPN would allow even the fact that Facetime or WhatsApp was used to communicate with someone to be hidden from an ISP.</p>
<p>Without a VPN, the ISP would record that a Facetime conversation occurred between the customer and another person, the length of the connection and the location of the customer at the time.</p>
<p>Of course, identifying the person that the customer talked to would still take some work in tracking down an internet address and again, this information might yield only the address of a VPN provider and not the individual.</p>
<p>VPNs are becoming an essential part of being on the internet. Apart from the privacy aspect, there is the added security they provide, especially when using unknown wireless networks such as in cafes, airports, or even at work. They also provide the ability to avoid geolocked content on services like Netflix, which up until the advent of metadata retention was the main reason for most people using a VPN, especially in Australia.</p>
<p>Given the commitments to privacy and security made by companies like Apple and Google, it would not be at all surprising if they started to provide their own VPN services to customers that were seamlessly built into their devices.</p>

<p>The Australian Federal Court ruled today that TPG, Optus, Telstra and other internet service providers (ISPs) must take “reasonable steps” to stop customers accessing file-sharing websites The Pirate Bay, IsoHunt, TorrentHound and Torrentz.</p>
<p>In total, Australian ISPs must block access to 61 domains registered to these four websites, or to the IP addresses specifically listed in the orders.</p>
<p>The court also ordered that addresses belonging to SolarMovie be blocked, even though it is no longer operational.</p>
<p>Importantly, the court refused a request that the ISPs be required to ban new domains or IP addresses as they pop up (the “whack-a-mole” problem). This is a win for due process, because it ensures that the court maintains control over the process.</p>
<p>But it also shows that this is largely a symbolic victory. The experience from overseas shows how easy it is for a site such as The Pirate Bay to change its address faster than courts can keep up.</p>
<p>Consumers can also easily use <a href="http://vpnranked.com">VPNs and proxies</a> to access the sites through private and secure connections.</p>
<p>The court ordered ISPs to block access within 15 business days of its decision. After this time, any user trying to access one of the blocked domains will be redirected to a webpage established by copyright owners, which will inform them that the domain has been blocked because of copyright infringement.</p>
<p>The Federal Court’s orders will be in effect for three years. During that time, if The Pirate Bay or any of the other websites operates from a different domain name, IP address or URL than those listed in the order, copyrights owners may apply to have the order extended to the site’s new location.</p>
